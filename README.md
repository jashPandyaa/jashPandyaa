I am a Web Developer Intern at Zidio Development and an enthusiastic student currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. As a fourth-semester student, I am passionate about web development and dedicated to learning new technologies every day.

My key technical skills include C, C++, Java, Database Management Systems, Data Structures, and core web development technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, Flexbox, Grid, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and version control with Git and GitHub. I am always eager to expand my knowledge and stay up to date with the latest industry trends.

In August 2024, I was honored with the Devang Mehta IT Award, recognizing my academic excellence. I currently hold a CGPA of 9.26.


I am excited to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world technology challenges and contribute meaningfully to the tech community.
